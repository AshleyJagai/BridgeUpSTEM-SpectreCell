# Getting started with GAIA

![GAIA map](https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/hires/2018/astronomerso.jpg)

## Work Set-Up

1. From Terminal, open BridgeUP-STEM-SpectreCell directory in atom

    `atom .`

2. From the sidebar in atom, open up `findcoordmatches.py`

3. Open up resources

  - [pandas documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)

  - [BDNYCdb tutorial](https://github.com/BDNYC/BDNYCdb/blob/master/tutorial/tutorial.md)

  - [astrodbkit documentation](https://astrodbkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)


## Project Pt. 1!

- ~~Use your code to read the GAIA csv file and load the BDNYC database~~

- ~~Print the column names for both datasets -- do they share any information? What can we use to crossmatch? How can we find the objects that exist in both datasets?~~

- ~~Create two new empty pandas dataframes~~

- ~~Give matches/new_objects dataframes the same columns as gaia_catalogue~~

- ~~Find a way to compare the datasets and store pre-existing objects in your matches array and the rest in your array of new objects~~

- Store your created dataframes as csv files with pandas (don't forget to give them descriptive names!)

- Make some plots?
