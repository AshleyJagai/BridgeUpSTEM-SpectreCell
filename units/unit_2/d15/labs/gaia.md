## Work Set-Up

[astrodbkit documentation](https://astrodbkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

1. Navigate to today's code folder

    `cd units/unit_2/d15/code`

2. create a new python file

    `touch project_processCSV.py`

3. Open new python file in atom

    `atom project_processCSV.py`

4. Let's open up the [BDNYCdb tutorial](https://github.com/BDNYC/BDNYCdb/blob/master/tutorial/tutorial.md) as a resource


## Project Pt. 1!

We have GAIA data!!

- Let's use pandas to load our new csv file (`gaia_data/all_catalog.csv`)

- Load the BDNYC database with astrodbkit

- Check out the column names for both data sets -- do they share any information? What can we use to crossmatch? How can we find the objects that exist in both datasets?
