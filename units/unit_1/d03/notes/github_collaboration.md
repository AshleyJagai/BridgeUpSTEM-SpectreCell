# Paired Activity

By collaborating over Github, each pair will add something to a readme file in a shared repository via Git/Github workflow.

- Choose one member's new repo to be shared. The 'owner' should add the other member as a collaborator in settings.
- Collaborator should accept invitation sent via email. Make sure to `git clone` in a new directory in terminal for a local version

### Create a new branch

Work your way through instructions as a team.

1. `cd` to your local repository
2. `git checkout -b dev` to create new branch called `dev`
  - the `master` branch should only be used for production-ready (aka working) code
3. pull from the master branch to update your code
4. COLLABORATOR: open readme.md and add your name.
5. COLLABORATOR: save, add, commit - **make sure your commit message is meaningful!**
6. COLLABORATOR: `git push origin dev` to submit changes to the `dev` branch.
7. COLLABORATOR: start a pull request on Github
8. OWNER: compare and merge teammate's changes on Github.
  - if no merge conflicts appear, then confirm merge with `master` branch.
9. pull from the master branch to update your code
10. OWNER: follow steps 4-8
11. pull from the master branch to update your code

That's it! Not bad, right? As we develop our code, this process will get more tricky, but we'll address issues as they come up.
