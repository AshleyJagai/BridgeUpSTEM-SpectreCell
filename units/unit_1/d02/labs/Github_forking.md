# Fork a repository

Forking a repository lets you play with the code and save it to your own repo without affecting the owner's code!

 1. go to [lesson repo](https://github.com/amnh/BridgeUP-STEM-SpectreCell)
 2. click on the Fork button
 3. choose the account to save it to (should be your username)
 4. cd to an easy-to-find directory in terminal (we'll be using this all year after all!)
 5. clone it to your local computer
 6. add/commit/push like normal!

## Updates from original repo

 1. In terminal, add original repo with `git remote add upstream https://github.com/amnh/BridgeUP-STEM-SpectreCell.git`
    - doesn't have to be called "upstream", but that's the convention
 2. `git pull upstream master` to update your local copy
