# SQL Training

If you're behind on Khan Academy, skip SQL Zoo take the opportunity to catch up.

## Programming with SQL Zoo

**Until 5:20pm**

Work through SQL Zoo problems on your own. If you're stuck, talk about it the problem with the rest of the group.

  1. [Nobel Prize Winners](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_from_Nobel_Tutorial)
  3. [SELECT within SELECT](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_within_SELECT_Tutorial)
  4. [SUM and COUNT](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SUM_and_COUNT)

## Continue SQL training with [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql/)

**Until 6:20pm**

 - As a group, we finished [More Advanced SQL Queries](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql#more-advanced-sql-queries). **We're skipping the Data Dig Challenge.**

 - Continue learning SQL with the [Relational Queries in SQL](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql/relational-queries-in-sql/a/splitting-data-into-related-tables) section. Start with reading the article _Splitting Data into Related Tables_.





    1. Use headphones when watching videos, but talk about problems and challenges as a group (like we have been). The only difference today should be the use of headphones for videos.

    2. Try to keep the same pace. If you finish challenges before your teammates, offer to help or continue SQL Zoo problems.
