# Revisiting our code

## Task 1:
  - push your current repo to origin master (so we don't overwrite anything without it being saved)

  - pull from upstream

  - open repo in atom
      - `atom .`

  - find `project_code/findcoordmatches.py `and inspect changes

<hr>


## Task 2:
  - write code to load the matches and new_objects csv files starting on line 20

  - make sure the code still works

<hr>


## Task 3:
  - Turn your code into functions
